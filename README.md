# SmartDoor
## --Andrew Plesniak and Renfan Yang 

SmartDoor is a system that uses computer vision and deep learning methods to recognize authorized users and unlock the door for them. It is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi 3 and is optimized for small form factor embedded systems with constrainded resources. This project was made as a capstone project for the Embedded System Design 2 class at the University of Pittsburgh. 

The code was originally adapted from Adrian Rosebrock's facial recognition tutorials over at [www.pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)
